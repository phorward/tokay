# Tokay

Tokay is a programming language designed for ad-hoc parsing.

> Tokay is under development and not considered for production use yet; Be part of Tokay's ongoing development, and [contribute](CONTRIBUTING.md)!

## About

Tokay is a programming language to quickly implement solutions for text processing problems. This can either be just simple data extractions, but also parsing entire structures or parts of it, and turning information into structured parse trees or abstract syntax trees for further processing.

Therefore, Tokay is both a tool and language for simple one-liners, but can also be used to implement code-analyzers, refactoring tools, interpreters, compilers or transpilers. Actually [Tokay's own language parser](src/compiler/tokay.tok) is implemented in Tokay itself.

Tokay is inspired by [awk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWK), has syntactic and semantic flavours of [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), but also follows its own philosophy, ideas and design principles. Thus, it isn't compareable to other languages or projects, and is a language on its own.

Tokay is still a very young project and gains much potential. [Volunteers are welcome!](CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Highlights

- Interpreted, procedural and imperative scripting language
- Concise and easy to learn syntax and object system
- Stream-based input processing
- Automatic parse tree construction and synthesis
- Left-recursive parsing structures ("parselets") supported
- Implements a memoizing packrat parsing algorithm internally
- Robust and fast, as it is written entirely in safe [Rust](https://rust-lang.org)
- Enabling awk-style one-liners in combination with other tools
- Generic parselets and functions
- Import system to create modularized programs (*coming soon)
- Embedded interoperability with other programs (*coming soon)

## Installation

By using Rusts dependency manager and build-tool `cargo`, simply install Tokay with

```bash
$ cargo install tokay
```

For Arch Linux-based distros, there is also a [`tokay`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/tokay) and [`tokay-git`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/tokay-git) package in the [Arch Linux AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/).

## Examples

Tokay's version of "Hello World" is quite obvious.

```tokay
print("Hello World")
```

> ```
> $ tokay 'print("Hello World")'
> Hello World
> ```

Tokay can also greet any wor(l)ds that are being fed to it. The next program prints "Hello Venus", "Hello Earth" or "Hello" followed by any other name previously parsed by the builtin `Word`-token. Any other input than a word is automatically omitted.

```tokay
print("Hello", Word)
```

> ```
> $ tokay 'print("Hello", Word)' -- "World 1337 Venus Mars 42 Max"
> Hello World
> Hello Venus
> Hello Mars
> Hello Max
> ```

A simple program for counting words which exists of a least three characters and printing a total can be implemented like this:

```tokay
Word(min=3) words += 1
end print(words)
```

> ```
> $ tokay "Word(min=3) words += 1; end print(words)" -- "this is just the 1st stage of 42.5 or .1 others"
> 5
> ```

The next, extended version of the program from above counts all words and numbers.

```tokay
Word words += 1
Number numbers += 1
end print(words || 0, "words,", numbers || 0, "numbers")
```

> ```
> $ tokay 'Word words += 1; Number numbers += 1; end print(words || 0, "words,", numbers || 0, "numbers")' -- "this is just the 1st stage of 42.5 or .1 others"
> 9 words, 3 numbers
> ```

By design, Tokay constructs syntax trees from consumed information automatically.

The next program directly implements a parser and interpreter for simple mathematical expressions, like `1 + 2 + 3` or `7 * (8 + 2) / 5`. The result of each expression is printed afterwards. Processing direct and indirect left-recursions without ending in infinite loops is one of Tokay's core features.

```tokay
_ : Char< \t>+            # redefine whitespace to just tab and space

Factor : @{
    Int _                 # built-in 64-bit signed integer token
    '(' _ Expr ')' _
}

Term : @{
    Term '*' _ Factor     $1 * $4
    Term '/' _ Factor     $1 / $4
    Factor
}

Expr : @{
    Expr '+' _ Term       $1 + $4
    Expr '-' _ Term       $1 - $4
    Term
}

Expr _ print("= " + $1)   # gives some neat result output
```

> ```
> $ tokay examples/expr_from_readme.tok
> 1 + 2 + 3
> = 6
> 7 * (8 + 2) / 5
> = 14
> 7*(3-9)
> = -42
> ...
> ```

Tokay can also be used for programs without any parsing features.<br>
Next is a recursive attempt for calculating the factorial of an integer.

```tokay
factorial : @x {
    if !x return 1
    x * factorial(x - 1)
}

factorial(4)
```

> ```
> $ tokay examples/factorial.tok
> 24
> ```

And this version of above program calculates the factorial for any integer token matches from the input. Just the invocation is different, and uses the Number token.

```tokay
factorial : @x {
    if !x return 1
    x * factorial(x - 1)
}

print(factorial(int(Number)))
```

> ```
> $ tokay examples/factorial2.tok -- "5 6 ignored 7 other 14 yeah"
> 120
> 720
> 5040
> 87178291200
> $ tokay examples/factorial2.tok
> 5
> 120
> 6
> 720
> ignored 7
> 5040
> other 14
> 87178291200
> ...

## Documentation

The Tokay homepage [tokay.dev](https://tokay.dev) provides links to a quick start and documentation. The documentation source code is maintained in a [separate repository](https://github.com/tokay-lang/tokay-docs).

## Logo

The Tokay programming language is named after the [Tokay gecko (Gekko gecko)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokay_gecko) from Asia, shouting out "token" in the night.

The Tokay logo and icon was thankfully designed by [Timmytiefkuehl](https://github.com/timmytiefkuehl).<br>
Check out the [tokay-artwork](https://github.com/tokay-lang/tokay-artwork) repository for different versions of the logo as well.
